# CubeRun
Welcome to CubeRun

This game is as simple as it sounds. You play as a cube, and you can use the "a" and "d" keys on the keyboard to move left and right respectively. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the level without hitting any of the obstacles along the way. Hitting an obstacle will cause the level to restart and it will also reset the number of metres you've travelled (the number above your head)

You can play the game for free here: https://blained.itch.io/cuberun
